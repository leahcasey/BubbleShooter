# BubbleShooter
Bubble Shooter Game is a Pygame-based game where players control a paddle using the Circuit Playground Express accelerometer or arrow keys if disconnected. The goal is to hit a moving bubble with a bullet, fired via a button press or space bar. Bullet collisions change bubble size and speed. NeoPixel lights give tilt feedback.
